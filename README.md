Analysis pipeline for the "Flooding the Zone" investigation into Tennessee Highway Patrol's collaboration with ICE. This investigation is a collaboration between Lighthouse Reports, Mother Jones, the Nashville Banner, Nashville Noticias, The Institute for Public Service Reporting Memphis, and News Channel 5 Nashville.

This repo contains code and data folders. Preprocessing scripts ingest raw data from 'data/input' and output processed and cleaned data into 'data/intermediary'. Analasys scripts ingest data from these intermediary folders and generate tables and graphs in 'data/results.' 

This pipeline primarily depends on ICE records published by the [Deportation Data Project](https://deportationdata.org). Because the raw and intermediary files are quite large, we have not republished them here. You can download them from the Deportation Data Project's [website](https://deportationdata.org/data/processed/ice.html). Pay careful attention to download the correct version of the data for reproducibility.
